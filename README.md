📈 Inflation Impact Analysis with Python

Datasets Used:
Inflation Rates (India & US): https://statso.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Inflation_Rates_Transformed-1.csv
INR–USD Exchange Rates (1980–2024): https://statso.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USD_INR_Exchange_Rates_1980_2024.csv

📘 Overview

This project analyzes how inflation rates in India and the United States influence the INR/USD exchange rate over time.
The datasets allow for longitudinal, side-by-side comparison of inflation rates and currency valuation, revealing meaningful economic relationships.

Using historical CPI-based inflation and annual exchange rate data from 1980–2024, the analysis explores:
Long-term inflation trends
INR/USD exchange rate movements
Correlations between inflation and exchange rates
How economic factors interact across countries
The datasets allow for longitudinal, side-by-side comparison of inflation rates and currency valuation, revealing meaningful economic relationships.

🔍 What is Inflation & Why It Matters

Inflation represents the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services.
It affects:
Purchasing power
Consumer spending
Investment decisions
Savings & financial planning

Exchange rates frequently respond to inflation differentials:
Higher inflation → weaker currency, and lower inflation → stronger currency (all else equal).

📊 Key Findings — Correlation Analysis

1️⃣ Exchange Rate vs. India Inflation
Correlation: -0.34 (weak negative)
As India's inflation rises, the INR tends to depreciate against the USD.
Relationship exists but is not strongly predictive.

2️⃣ Exchange Rate vs. US Inflation
Correlation: +0.24 (weak positive)
Higher US inflation slightly aligns with a weaker USD relative to the INR.
Again, not a strong correlation.

3️⃣ India Inflation vs. US Inflation
Correlation: -0.12 (very weak)
Inflation trends in the two countries do not move together.

🧠 Conclusion

Inflation in India and the United States does affect the INR/USD exchange rate — but only as one of many influencing factors.
Higher inflation in India contributes to INR depreciation.
Lower inflation in the US supports USD strength.
However, exchange rates are also shaped by broader economic, political, and global variables.
Inflation explains some—but not all—of the movement in INR/USD over the past four decades.
